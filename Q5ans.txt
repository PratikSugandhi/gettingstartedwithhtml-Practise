Q.5 What is DOC TYPE declaration in HTML?
ANS :
All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.

The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.

In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:

<!DOCTYPE html>
Doctype HTML is a declaration that tells the browser what version of HTML the document is written in. This declaration appears as the very first line in an HTML file.
